v2.0.0

removed jest tests; tested all functionality manually in browser
removed (currently) unused components from package
ALL other HTMLCanvasElement functionality can be accessed still via public Canvas.ctx

Canvas:
simplified constructor
removed superfluous methods that are not requried in most projects

CanvasColor:
removed gradient and pattern functionality
just has fill() and stroke() methods now

CanvasPath:
removed non-zero alternatives
just left fill, stroke and clip + basic shapes line, circle, rectangle, square

CanvasFont:
re-wrote entirely
removed convenience methods that were clogging up the class
still resets if client calls save(fn) method
added method chaining and removed clunky setAll()

CanvasText:
removed convenience methods as cluttering class up
removed maxWidth param from fill() and stroke() as not currently used
added method chaining to ALL methods so can be called and chained together in any order
removed clunky setAll() method

CanvasImage:
added sprite(sprite, width, height) method for convenient way to render an iSprite (from library)
changed cell(...) method name to segment(...), which, I think, makes more sense

CanvasFilter:
removed constructor() as testing manually/visually
removed clunky setAll(...) method
still resets if client calls save(fn) method
completely re-wrote with cleaner implementation and using clamp() function from Maths package
added method chaining to each filter function method

FULLY tested functionality visually in browser


v2.1.0
    removed CanvasFilter.dropShadow() method - very intensive and slows down animations
        replaced with CanvasShadow component
            does the same job much more efficiently
            uses context.shadow... properties instead
    added method chaining to Canvas class methods - translate(), rotate(), opacity(), scale()
        creates a nicer interface for clients to use - set all common canvas settings in one line
    
    FULLY tested new functionality visually in browser

v3.0.0
    Canvas class:
        tidied up constructor by extracting private methods
        moved components into single private components property
        changed scale(n) method to accept 1 param instead of 2, scales x and y with same value
        added scaleXY(x,y) to replace former scale() method so client can scale axis separately if required
        canvas element now has width, height = 'inherit' and position = 'absolute' styles applied
            this behaviour can be turned off by setting static Canvas.CONTAINED property to false
    
    AbstractCanvasComponent
        components now accept ctx in an init() method, not constructor
    
    CanvasFont
        stretch, kerning and variantCaps methods now return this for method chaining

    CanvasLine
        removed thickness()
        added:
            width(n)
            dash(segments, offset)
            cap(type)
            join(type)
            all return this so can be chained

v4.0.0
    imported ImageSprite v4.0.0 with different interface
    amended sprite() method in CanvasImage to reflect changes AND now only require an ImageSprite as param (ImageSprite is already scaled to correct size)

v5.0.0
    imported ImageSprite v5.0.0 with original interface
    the previous implementation was wrong - client needs to specify the width and height of the sprite on each render

v5.1.0
    added both() method to Color module to set both the stroke and fill color at the same time
    added download() method to Canvas class to download current canvas image as a file in the browser
