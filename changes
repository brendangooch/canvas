v2.0.0

removed jest tests; tested all functionality manually in browser
removed (currently) unused components from package
ALL other HTMLCanvasElement functionality can be accessed still via public Canvas.ctx

Canvas:
simplified constructor
removed superfluous methods that are not requried in most projects

CanvasColor:
removed gradient and pattern functionality
just has fill() and stroke() methods now

CanvasPath:
removed non-zero alternatives
just left fill, stroke and clip + basic shapes line, circle, rectangle, square

CanvasFont:
re-wrote entirely
removed convenience methods that were clogging up the class
still resets if client calls save(fn) method
added method chaining and removed clunky setAll()

CanvasText:
removed convenience methods as cluttering class up
removed maxWidth param from fill() and stroke() as not currently used
added method chaining to ALL methods so can be called and chained together in any order
removed clunky setAll() method

CanvasImage:
added sprite(sprite, width, height) method for convenient way to render an iSprite (from library)
changed cell(...) method name to segment(...), which, I think, makes more sense

CanvasFilter:
removed constructor() as testing manually/visually
removed clunky setAll(...) method
still resets if client calls save(fn) method
completely re-wrote with cleaner implementation and using clamp() function from Maths package
added method chaining to each filter function method

FULLY tested functionality visually in browser


v2.1.0
    removed CanvasFilter.dropShadow() method - very intensive and slows down animations
        replaced with CanvasShadow component
            does the same job much more efficiently
            uses context.shadow... properties instead
    added method chaining to Canvas class methods - translate(), rotate(), opacity(), scale()
        creates a nicer interface for clients to use - set all common canvas settings in one line
